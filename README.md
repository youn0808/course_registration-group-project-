## This Project was conducted during COMP 3020(Human-Computer Interaction) group project

### Purpose of the project.

- The first idea is centered around a student-specified class-priority list for creating class schedules for a term. To start the schedule generating process, the student will use the search bar to search for classes they find interesting or need to take for their degree. Students can then add these courses to a priority-ranking system that our new website will use to generate possible class schedules. The student can then sift through the generated class schedules and pick the one they like the most. The student may even modify their chosen class schedule or modify the class-priority list in order for the website to generate new schedules. The website will generate schedules based on a simple algorithm that will be determined for the hi-fidelity prototype should the team choose to incorporate this design. For this idea, the website will use a time-horizontal timetable to display the class schedule(s) to students. This allows the timetable to take up less space to display class schedules and allows course information to be displayed beside the timetables; this means there can be more relevant information that is displayed to the user.

- The major features of this prototype were the ability to add classes to a planner, prioritize classes using a drag-and-drop interface, view possible schedules based on the priority list, and view detailed information about classes. Each of these features and their depth of implementation are discussed in this section.
